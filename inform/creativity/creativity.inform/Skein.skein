You are standing in a spacious room made of reinforced concrete. A lighting panel illuminates the room in a tense white glow. There is another room to the south.

An alcove is carved into the wall in front of you. Hovering in the alcove are a SHIELD alloy, a BLADE alloy, an ENTROPIC alloy, a MEND alloy and a SPARK alloy.

A large red button labeled RESUPPLY is mounted above the alcove.

WELCOME TO THE QUALIFICATION DETERMINATION SIMULATION COMBINATION STATION! HERE YOU CAN TAKE ELEMENTS FROM THE PREVIOUS ROOM AND FORM THEM INTO NEW AND FANCIFUL CREATIONS. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? LET'S GET CREATIVE!

You are standing in another concrete room. There are exits to the North and South. In the center is a vast machine labeled 'Combinator'. The machine has 3 slots to put elements in:

Slot 1 is empty.

Slot 2 is empty.

Slot 3 is empty.

You can also see a green button labelled GO here.

You put the SHIELD alloy into slot 1.

Slot 1 is full, so let's put MEND alloy in slot 2. You put the MEND alloy into slot 2.

WELCOME TO THE QUALIFICATION DETERMINATION SIMULATION COMBINATION STATION! HERE YOU CAN TAKE ELEMENTS FROM THE PREVIOUS ROOM AND FORM THEM INTO NEW AND FANCIFUL CREATIONS. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? LET'S GET CREATIVE!

You are standing in another concrete room. There are exits to the North and South. In the center is a vast machine labeled 'Combinator'. The machine has 3 slots to put elements in:

Slot 1 is empty.

Slot 2 is empty.

Slot 3 is empty.

You can also see a green button labelled GO here.

WELCOME TO THE QUALIFICATION DETERMINATION SIMULATION COMBINATION STATION! HERE YOU CAN TAKE ELEMENTS FROM THE PREVIOUS ROOM AND FORM THEM INTO NEW AND FANCIFUL CREATIONS. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? LET'S GET CREATIVE!

You are standing in another concrete room. There are exits to the North and South. In the center is a vast machine labeled 'Combinator'. The machine has 3 slots to put elements in:

Slot 1 is empty.

Slot 2 is empty.

Slot 3 is empty.

You can also see a green button labelled GO here.

You put the SHIELD alloy into slot 1.

Slot 1 is full, so let's put BLADE alloy in slot 2. You put the BLADE alloy into slot 2.

Slot 1 is full, so let's put MEND alloy in slot 2. Slot 2 is full, so let's put MEND alloy in slot 3. You put the MEND alloy into slot 3.

Supply Room
You are standing in a spacious room made of reinforced concrete. A lighting panel illuminates the room in a tense white glow. There is another room to the south.

An alcove is carved into the wall in front of you. Hovering in the alcove are an ENTROPIC alloy and a SPARK alloy.

A large red button labeled RESUPPLY is mounted above the alcove.

You can also see a SHIELD alloy, a MEND alloy and a BLADE alloy here.

HELLO AGAIN! I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE... THE RATINGS MODULE! HUMAN FEEDBACK IS CRUCIAL TO CREATIVITRIX, AND THIS LITTLE GUY IS HERE TO COLLECT IT! I'LL LET HIM TALK:

Slot 1 contains nothing.

An alcove is carved into the wall in front of you. Hovering in the alcove are a SHIELD alloy, a BLADE alloy, an ENTROPIC alloy, a SALVE alloy and a SPARK alloy
