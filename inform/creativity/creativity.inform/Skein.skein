Supply Room
You are standing in a spacious room made of reinforced concrete. A lighting panel illuminates the room in a tense white glow. There is another room to the SOUTH.

An alcove is carved into the wall in front of you. Hovering in the alcove are a SHIELD alloy, a BLADE alloy, an ENTROPIC alloy, a MEND alloy and a SPARK alloy.

A large red button labeled RESUPPLY is mounted above the alcove.

WELCOME TO THE QUALIFICATION DETERMINATION SIMULATION COMBINATION STATION! HERE YOU CAN TAKE ELEMENTS FROM THE PREVIOUS ROOM AND FORM THEM INTO NEW AND FANCIFUL CREATIONS. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? LET'S GET CREATIVE!

You are standing in another concrete room. There are exits to the North and South. In the center is a vast machine labeled 'Combinator'. The machine has 3 slots to put elements in:

Slot 1 is empty.

Slot 2 is empty.

Slot 3 is empty.

You can also see a green button labelled GO and Intern Jim here.

Slot 2 is empty.

Slot 3 is empty.

You can also see a green button labelled GO and Intern Jim here.

You walk to the Combination Station.

You put the SHIELD alloy into slot 1.

This is another large, barren concrete room. Exits are to the north and south.

There is a hostile entity trapped by a force field on the other half of the room from you.

The entity grins at you. Well, not so much "grin" as "curl back its lips and roll its eyes back into its head."

Combination Station
WELCOME TO THE QUALIFICATION DETERMINATION SIMULATION COMBINATION STATION! HERE YOU CAN TAKE ALLOYS FROM THE PREVIOUS ROOM AND FORM THEM INTO NEW AND FANCIFUL CREATIONS. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? LET'S GET CREATIVE!

You are standing in another concrete room. There are exits to the North and South. In the center is a vast machine labeled 'Combinator'. The machine has 3 slots to put alloys in:

Slot 1 is empty.

Slot 2 is empty.

Slot 3 is empty.

You can also see a green button labelled GO and Intern Jim here.

This is another large, barren concrete room. Exits are to the north and south.

There is a hostile entity trapped by a force field on the other half of the room from you.

The entity grins at you. Well, not so much "grin" as "curl back its lips and roll its eyes back into its head."

The SHIELD and MELD alloys combine to form a magical helmet, and the SPARK alloy makes itself busy by creating a system that diagnoses and heals your wounds. Neat!


AMAZING! THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE HEALING HELMET YOU'VE JUST CREATED! I'M AWARDING YOU 20 CREATIVITY POINTS FOR IT.




You now carry a brand-new healing helmet.

[Your score has just gone up by twenty points.]

Combination Station
WELCOME TO THE QUALIFICATION DETERMINATION SIMULATION COMBINATION STATION! HERE YOU CAN TAKE ELEMENTS FROM THE PREVIOUS ROOM AND FORM THEM INTO NEW AND FANCIFUL CREATIONS. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? LET'S GET CREATIVE!

You are standing in another concrete room. There are exits to the North and South. In the center is a vast machine labeled 'Combinator'. The machine has 3 slots to put elements in:

Slot 1 is empty.

Slot 2 is empty.

Slot 3 is empty.

You can also see a green button labelled GO here.

You put the BLADE alloy into slot 1.

Slot 1 is full, so let's put ENTROPIC alloy in slot 2. You put the ENTROPIC alloy into slot 2.

Slot 1 is full, so let's put MEND alloy in slot 2. Slot 2 is full, so let's put MEND alloy in slot 3. You put the MEND alloy into slot 3.

WELCOME TO THE QUALIFICATION DETERMINATION SIMULATION COMBINATION STATION! HERE YOU CAN TAKE ALLOYS FROM THE PREVIOUS ROOM AND FORM THEM INTO NEW AND FANCIFUL CREATIONS. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? LET'S GET CREATIVE!

You are standing in another concrete room. There are exits to the North and South. In the center is a vast machine labeled 'Combinator'. The machine has 3 slots to put alloys in:

Slot 1 is empty.

Slot 2 is empty.

Slot 3 is empty.

You can also see a green button labelled GO and Intern Jim here.

STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT CREATIVITY IS BOOSTED BY 57% UPON THE INTRODUCTION OF A HOSTILE ENTITY! THUS, WE HAVE PROVIDED AN ENEMY FOR YOU TO DEFEAT IN THIS ROOM. PRESS THE BUTTON WHEN YOU FEEL YOU ARE READY TO FIGHT IT!

This is another large, barren concrete room. Exits are to the north and south.

There is a hostile entity trapped by a force field on the other half of the room from you.

The entity grins at you. Well, not so much "grin" as "curl back its lips and roll its eyes back into its head."

Supply Room
You are standing in a spacious room made of reinforced concrete. A lighting panel illuminates the room in a tense white glow. There is another room to the south.

An alcove is carved into the wall in front of you. Hovering in the alcove are a SHIELD alloy, a BLADE alloy, an ENTROPIC alloy, a MEND alloy and a SPARK alloy.

A large red button labeled RESUPPLY is mounted above the alcove.

"You want to know about the Creativitrix? Well, it's simple. As you can probably tell, AI these is really good at computing and simulating, but is terrible at coming up with original ideas! I mean, the name of this thing is just CREATIVITY plus MATRIX for crying out loud. If you're creative enough, you can sign up as an Endpoint and help come up with original ideas for the AI.

STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT CREATIVITY IS BOOSTED BY 57% UPON THE INTRODUCTION OF A HOSTILE ENTITY! THUS, WE HAVE PROVIDED AN ENEMY FOR YOU TO DEFEAT IN THIS ROOM. PRESS THE BUTTON WHEN YOU FEEL YOU ARE READY TO FIGHT IT!

This is another large, barren concrete room. Exits are to the north and south.

There is a hostile entity trapped by a force field on the other half of the room from you.

The entity grins at you. Well, not so much "grin" as "curl back its lips and roll its eyes back into its head."

You are standing in another concrete room. There are exits to the North and South. In the center is a vast machine labeled 'Combinator'. The machine has 3 slots to put elements in:

Slot 1 is empty.

Slot 2 is empty.

You can also see a green button labelled GO and Intern Jim here.

The entity suddenly leaps up and clings to the ceiling. Its face suddenly looks confused and hurt.

STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT CREATIVITY IS BOOSTED BY 57% UPON THE INTRODUCTION OF A HOSTILE ENTITY! THUS, WE HAVE PROVIDED AN ENEMY FOR YOU TO DEFEAT IN THIS ROOM. PRESS THE BUTTON WHEN YOU FEEL YOU ARE READY TO FIGHT IT!

This is another large, barren concrete room. Exits are to the north and south.

There is a hostile entity trapped by a force field on the other half of the room from you.

The entity grins at you. Well, not so much "grin" as "curl back its lips and roll its eyes back into its head."

You walk to the Combination Station.

You put the SHIELD alloy into slot 1.

Slot 1 is full, so let's put BLADE alloy in slot 2. You put the BLADE alloy into slot 2.

Slot 1 is full, so let's put ENTROPIC alloy in slot 2. Slot 2 is full, so let's put ENTROPIC alloy in slot 3. You put the ENTROPIC alloy into slot 3.

Ingredient list: BLADE alloy, ENTROPIC alloy and SHIELD alloy

The SHIELD alloy quickly wraps itself around the volatile ENTROPIC alloy. Then, the BLADE alloy adds dangerous-looking spikes to the outside of the resulting ball.


AMAZING! THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE SPIKED GRENADE YOU'VE JUST CREATED! I'M AWARDING YOU 20 CREATIVITY POINTS FOR IT.




You now carry a brand-new spiked grenade.




You now carry a brand-new chestplate of retribution.

You are standing in a spacious room made of reinforced concrete. A lighting panel illuminates the room in a tense white glow. There is another room to the south.

An alcove is carved into the wall in front of you. Hovering in the alcove are a SHIELD alloy, a BLADE alloy, an ENTROPIC alloy and a SPARK alloy.

A large red button labeled RESUPPLY is mounted above the alcove.

STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT CREATIVITY IS BOOSTED BY 57% UPON THE INTRODUCTION OF A HOSTILE ENTITY! THUS, WE HAVE PROVIDED AN ENEMY FOR YOU TO DEFEAT IN THIS ROOM. PRESS THE BUTTON WHEN YOU FEEL YOU ARE READY TO FIGHT IT! This is another large, barren concrete room. Exits are to the north and south.

There is a hostile entity trapped by a force field on the other half of the room from you.

You can also see an orange fight button here.

The entity sucks in air, its ribcabe jutting out as its torso compresses into an impossible skinniness.
